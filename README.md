## Origin Story

This project was born from a real, personal problem.

As a Senior Engineer, I receive a constant stream of recruiter messages — through LinkedIn, email, and freelance platforms. Most are irrelevant or spam, but some are genuinely interesting opportunities. The problem? There are too many to review manually, and the good ones get buried under the noise.

For a while, I tried using a **Gemini Gem** (custom GPT-like assistant) to help me evaluate offers. It worked... until it didn't. Google wiped my conversation history multiple times, and with it, all the context about which offers I was tracking, what stage each conversation was in, and what I had already responded. There was no persistence, no lifecycle tracking, and no structured data — just a chat window that could vanish at any moment.

I needed something purpose-built: a system that would **persist** my data, **structure** the extraction, **score** offers against my preferences, **draft** professional responses, and **track** where each conversation stands — all without depending on a third-party chat history that could disappear.

That frustration became the motivation for **Talent Inbound OS** — and the perfect challenge for a Master's Final Project in AI-assisted development.

## Project Description

As a Senior Engineer, you receive dozens of recruiter messages every week — through LinkedIn, email, and freelance platforms. Most are spam or irrelevant. The few that matter get lost in the noise. Tracking conversations, evaluating fit, and drafting professional responses manually is time-consuming and error-prone.

**Talent Inbound OS** solves this problem by acting as an intelligent firewall and executive assistant for inbound recruiting:

1. **Paste** a recruiter message (LinkedIn, Email, freelance platforms)
2. The **AI pipeline** automatically classifies it (spam vs. real offer), extracts structured data (company, role, salary, tech stack, remote model), scores how well it matches your profile, and drafts a diplomatic response
3. **Review** the AI's work, edit the draft if needed, and track the opportunity through its lifecycle

The system enforces a **human-in-the-loop** principle: the AI prepares everything, but the user always has the final say. No message is ever auto-sent.

### Problem Statement

| Without Talent Inbound OS | With Talent Inbound OS |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Manually reading every recruiter message | AI classifies and filters spam automatically |
| No structured data — mental notes only | Structured extraction: company, salary, stack, role |
| No way to know if an offer fits your profile | Automated match scoring (0-100) against your preferences |
| Writing responses from scratch every time | AI-drafted responses adapted to context |
| Losing track of conversations, ghosting | Opportunity lifecycle tracking with follow-up alerts |

---

## Key Features

### Authentication & Security
- JWT-based authentication with HTTP-only cookies (access + refresh tokens)
- Password strength validation (min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, digit)
- Cross-user data isolation — every query is scoped to the authenticated candidate
- Secure cookie handling for cross-origin deployments (SameSite, Secure flags)

### Candidate Profile
- Professional profile: name, title, skills, salary expectations, work model preferences
- CV upload (PDF/DOCX) with text extraction for future vector-based scoring
- Configurable thresholds for follow-up and ghosting alerts
- Profile completeness gate — must fill required fields before submitting offers

### Offer Ingestion
- Copy-paste recruiter messages from any source (LinkedIn, Email, Freelance, Other)
- Two-action workflow: paste + confirm (frictionless ingestion)
- Duplicate detection — prevents re-processing the same message

### AI Agent Pipeline (7 stages)
- **Guardrail & Sanitizer** — Two-layer defense: regex + FAST-tier LLM for PII cleanup and prompt-injection detection
- **Gatekeeper** — Spam vs. real offer classification (rejects noise)
- **Extractor** — Structured data extraction (company, role, salary, stack, remote, recruiter)
- **Language Detector** — Detects recruiter message language (en/es) for correct draft language
- **Analyst** — Match scoring (0-100) against candidate profile with detailed reasoning
- **Communicator** — Context-aware response drafts (ask for info, accept, politely decline)
- **Stage Detector** — Suggests lifecycle stage transitions based on conversation context

### Opportunity Dashboard
- Filterable by stage (Discovery, Engaging, Interviewing, Negotiating, Offer, Rejected, Declined, Ghosted)
- Sortable by date or match score
- Stale opportunity alerts (configurable threshold)
- Pagination with configurable page size
- Archive/restore functionality

### Conversational Cycle
- Review and edit AI-drafted responses before sending
- Confirm when a draft is sent — auto-advances stage from Discovery to Engaging, or to Declined when a decline draft is sent
- Submit follow-up recruiter messages for re-analysis
- The follow-up pipeline preserves context and does not force stage changes

### Opportunity Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> DISCOVERY : New offer ingested
    DISCOVERY --> ENGAGING : User confirms draft sent
    ENGAGING --> INTERVIEWING : AI detects interview scheduling
    INTERVIEWING --> NEGOTIATING : AI detects offer discussion
    NEGOTIATING --> OFFER : Formal offer received
    DISCOVERY --> DECLINED : User sends decline response
    ENGAGING --> DECLINED : User sends decline response
    INTERVIEWING --> DECLINED : User sends decline response
    NEGOTIATING --> DECLINED : User sends decline response
    DISCOVERY --> REJECTED : Company/recruiter rejects
    ENGAGING --> REJECTED : Company/recruiter rejects
    INTERVIEWING --> REJECTED : Company/recruiter rejects
    NEGOTIATING --> REJECTED : Company/recruiter rejects
    ENGAGING --> GHOSTED : No response (threshold exceeded)
    INTERVIEWING --> GHOSTED : No response (threshold exceeded)
    NEGOTIATING --> GHOSTED : No response (threshold exceeded)
```

- Stage suggestions via AI (user accepts or dismisses)
- Visual stage progress indicator
- Full interaction history per opportunity

### Real-time Pipeline Feedback
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live pipeline progress
- Step-by-step status updates as each agent completes

```

### Design Principles

- **Modular Monolith** — Organized by business modules (`auth`, `profile`, `ingestion`, `pipeline`, `opportunities`), not technical layers. Each module has its own `domain/`, `application/`, `presentation/`, and `infrastructure/` layers.
- **Clean Architecture** — Dependencies point inward. Domain has no external imports. Infrastructure adapts to domain interfaces.
- **2-Model Separation** — Pydantic models for the domain, SQLAlchemy ORM models for persistence. Explicit mapping between them.
- **Dependency Injection** — All wiring happens in `container.py` using the `dependency-injector` library. No hidden globals.

## AI Agent Pipeline

The core differentiator of the project. When a user pastes a recruiter message, it flows through a **LangGraph** stateful graph with 7 sequential agents:

```mermaid
graph TD
    MSG["Raw Recruiter Message"]

    MSG --> G1

    G1["1. Guardrail & Sanitizer<br/>Regex + LLM prompt injection + PII cleanup"]
    G1 -->|Clean| G2
    G1 -->|Injection detected| BLK["Blocked"]

    G2["2. Gatekeeper<br/>Spam vs. real offer classification"]
    G2 -->|Real offer| G3
    G2 -->|Spam / Not an offer| REJ["Rejected"]

    G3["3. Extractor<br/>Company, Role, Salary, Stack, Remote, Recruiter"]
    G3 --> G4

    G4["4. Language Detector<br/>Detects en/es for draft language"]
    G4 -->|Missing fields| INCOMPLETE["Incomplete (manual draft)"]
    G4 -->|All fields present| G5

    G5["5. Analyst<br/>Match score (0-100) vs. Candidate Profile"]
    G5 --> G6

    G6["6. Communicator<br/>Drafts context-aware response"]
    G6 --> G7

    G7["7. Stage Detector<br/>Suggests lifecycle stage transition"]
    G7 --> DONE["Opportunity ready for review"]

    style REJ fill:#fee2e2,stroke:#ef4444
    style BLK fill:#fee2e2,stroke:#ef4444
    style INCOMPLETE fill:#fef3c7,stroke:#f59e0b
    style DONE fill:#dcfce7,stroke:#22c55e
```

Each agent is powered by **Claude** (Anthropic) models via LangChain:
- **Fast model** (Claude Haiku 4.5): Guardrail, Gatekeeper, Language Detector, Stage Detector
- **Smart model** (Claude Sonnet 4.5/4.6): Extractor, Analyst, Communicator

The pipeline supports two modes:
- **Initial analysis**: Full pipeline (all 7 agents) for a new recruiter message
- **Follow-up analysis**: Skips the Gatekeeper (already validated) and re-evaluates with conversation context

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** with `pip`
- **Node.js 20+** with **pnpm** (`npm install -g pnpm`)
- **PostgreSQL 16** running locally (or via Docker)
- **Anthropic API key** (for Claude models — [get one here](https://console.anthropic.com/))

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CristopherRL/talent-inbound-os.git
cd talent-inbound-os
```

### 2. Backend setup

```bash
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate it
# Linux/macOS:
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your values:
#   DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@localhost:5432/talent_inbound
#   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
#   JWT_SECRET_KEY=<generate with: openssl rand -hex 32>

# Run database migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Start the backend
uvicorn src.talent_inbound.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

### 3. Frontend setup

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies (use pnpm, NOT npm)
pnpm install

# Start the development server
pnpm dev
```

The frontend runs at `http://127.0.0.1:3000` and the backend API at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

> **Note (Windows):** Always use `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` to avoid IPv6 resolution issues.

```bash
cd backend

# Unit tests (fast, no external dependencies)
python -m pytest tests/unit -v

# Integration tests (requires Docker for testcontainers)
python -m pytest tests/integration -v

# E2E tests (requires running PostgreSQL)
python -m pytest tests/e2e -v

# All tests with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
```

### 5. Admin utilities

```bash
# Reset a user's password (CLI command)
cd backend
python -m talent_inbound.cli reset-password user@example.com NewPassword123
```

    RW --> DB
```

| Service | Source | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Backend** | `backend/Dockerfile` | Runs Alembic migrations on startup, then uvicorn |
| **Frontend** | `frontend/Dockerfile` | Multi-stage build, Next.js standalone output |
| **PostgreSQL** | Railway managed | Provisioned as a Railway add-on |

### Key Environment Variables

**Backend:**
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Must use `postgresql+asyncpg://` scheme |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Claude API key |
| `JWT_SECRET_KEY` | Secret for JWT signing |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated allowed origins (exact frontend URL) |
| `ENVIRONMENT` | `production` for secure cookies, `development` for local |

**Frontend:**
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | Full backend URL (build-time — requires rebuild on change) |

### Deployment steps

1. Create a Railway project with PostgreSQL
2. Add a backend service pointing to `backend/Dockerfile` — set env vars
3. Add a frontend service pointing to `frontend/Dockerfile` — set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
4. Configure CORS on the backend to match the frontend's public URL
5. Railway auto-deploys on every push to `main`

For detailed step-by-step instructions, see `.context/Railway Deployment Guide.md`.

## Development Methodology

### Spec-Driven Development (SDD)

This project follows a strict **no code without a spec** methodology, enforced through **Speckit** — a custom tooling system integrated with Claude Code:

```mermaid
graph LR
    S["/speckit.specify<br/>📝 Spec"]
    C["/speckit.clarify<br/>❓ Clarify"]
    P["/speckit.plan<br/>📐 Plan"]
    T["/speckit.tasks<br/>📋 Tasks"]
    A["/speckit.analyze<br/>🔍 Analyze"]
    I["/speckit.implement<br/>⚙️ Implement"]

    S --> C --> P --> T --> A --> I
    A -->|Issues found| S
```

1. **Specify** (`/speckit.specify`): Define the feature in a structured specification — user stories, acceptance criteria, edge cases, security considerations
2. **Clarify** (`/speckit.clarify`): Identify underspecified areas and encode answers back
3. **Plan** (`/speckit.plan`): Generate the implementation plan — data model, API contracts, component design, dependency graph
4. **Tasks** (`/speckit.tasks`): Break down the plan into dependency-ordered, atomic tasks
5. **Analyze** (`/speckit.analyze`): Cross-artifact consistency check (spec ↔ plan ↔ tasks)
6. **Implement** (`/speckit.implement`): Execute tasks one by one with automated quality checks

All SDD artifacts are preserved in `specs/001-mvp-platform-core/`:

| Artifact | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `spec.md` | Feature specification with 7 user stories |
| `plan.md` | Implementation plan with architectural decisions |
| `tasks.md` | 158 dependency-ordered tasks across 11 phases |
| `data-model.md` | Entity-relationship model |
| `contracts/` | API contract definitions |
| `research.md` | Technical research notes |
| `checklists/` | Quality checklists per phase |
| `quickstart.md` | Quick reference for the spec |

### Project Constitution

A living governance document (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) with 7 core principles that every design decision must comply with:

1. **Data Privacy First** — PII sanitized before external LLM calls
2. **Data First** — Missing critical data flagged as INCOMPLETE_INFO before scoring
3. **High-Signal, Low-Noise** — Aggressively filter spam; <2% false-positive rate
4. **Human-in-the-Loop** — Never auto-send messages; user always reviews
5. **Frictionless Ingestion** — Copy-paste primary entry (max 2 user actions)
6. **Observability & Safety** — Full traceability of every agent step
7. **Professional Tone** — All generated content reflects Senior/Staff-level standing

---

## AI-Assisted Development

This project was built using **Claude Code** (Anthropic's CLI agent) as an AI copilot throughout the entire development lifecycle — from specification to deployment.

### How Claude Code was used

| Phase | How AI assisted |
|-------|----------------|
| **Specification** | Speckit slash commands driven by Claude Code to generate and refine specs |
| **Architecture** | Design decisions discussed interactively — Clean Architecture, module boundaries, DI patterns |
| **Implementation** | Code generation guided by specs, with human review and iteration on every piece |
| **Testing** | Test scaffolding and edge case identification |
| **Debugging** | Real-time diagnosis of deployment issues (CORS, cookies, Docker) |
| **Documentation** | Context7 MCP for up-to-date library docs; structured knowledge in CLAUDE.md |

### Key AI development artifacts

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Project-level instructions for the AI copilot — architecture rules, domain language, conventions |
| `.specify/memory/constitution.md` | Governance principles the AI must follow |
| `.context/Session Tracker.md` | Session continuity — tracks where we left off between conversations |
| `.context/conversation_history/` | Exported conversation logs documenting the development process |
| `specs/001-mvp-platform-core/` | All SDD artifacts generated through AI-assisted workflow |

### Lessons learned

- **Spec-first approach** prevents scope creep and ensures the AI stays focused on what was agreed
- **Constitution as guardrails** keeps AI-generated code aligned with project values (security, privacy, UX)
- **Session tracking** is essential for multi-session AI development — without it, context is lost
- **Context7 MCP** for documentation lookup prevents hallucinated APIs and outdated patterns
- **Human-in-the-loop** applies to AI-assisted development too — every decision was reviewed and understood
